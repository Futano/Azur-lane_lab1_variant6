# Azur lane - lab 1 - variant 6

This is an example project which demonstrates project structure and necessary CI checks.
It is not the best structure for real-world projects, but good enough for educational purposes.

## Project structure

- `Binary tree.py` -- implementation of `Binary tree` class with `add`, `delete`, `update`, and `search` features.
- `Binary tree_test.py` -- Unit tests for the Binary tree class.

## Features

- **PBT: test_add**  
  Test whether new elements can be added into the binary tree.
- **PBT: test_delete**  
  Test whether the corresponding node can be deleted through the index without destroying the binary tree structure.
- **PBT: test_set**  
  Test whether the corresponding value can be changed through the index to generate a new value.
- **PBT: test_search**  
  Test whether the corresponding value can be obtained through the index.
- **PBT: test_handle_none**  
  Test whether it can handle empty values and ensure that the binary tree structure will not report errors.
